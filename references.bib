	ABSTRACT = {The use of low-cost environmental sensors has gained significant attention due to their affordability and potential to intensify environmental monitoring networks. These sensors enable real-time monitoring of various environmental parameters, which can help identify pollution hotspots and inform targeted mitigation strategies. Low-cost sensors also facilitate citizen science projects, providing more localized and granular data, and making environmental monitoring more accessible to communities. However, the accuracy and reliability of data generated by these sensors can be a concern, particularly without proper calibration. Calibration is challenging for low-cost sensors due to the variability in sensing materials, transducer designs, and environmental conditions. Therefore, standardized calibration protocols are necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of low-cost sensor data. This review article addresses four critical questions related to the calibration and accuracy of low-cost sensors. Firstly, it discusses why low-cost sensors are increasingly being used as an alternative to high-cost sensors. In addition, it discusses self-calibration techniques and how they outperform traditional techniques. Secondly, the review highlights the importance of selectivity and sensitivity of low-cost sensors in generating accurate data. Thirdly, it examines the impact of calibration functions on improved accuracies. Lastly, the review discusses various approaches that can be adopted to improve the accuracy of low-cost sensors, such as incorporating advanced data analysis techniques and enhancing the sensing material and transducer design. The use of reference-grade sensors for calibration and validation can also help improve the accuracy and reliability of low-cost sensor data. In conclusion, low-cost environmental sensors have the potential to revolutionize environmental monitoring, particularly in areas where traditional monitoring methods are not feasible. However, the accuracy and reliability of data generated by these sensors are critical for their successful implementation. Therefore, standardized calibration protocols and innovative approaches to enhance the sensing material and transducer design are necessary to ensure the accuracy and reliability of low-cost sensor data.},

	abstract = {Low-cost air quality sensors can help increase spatial and temporal resolution of air pollution exposure measurements. These sensors, however, most often produce data of lower accuracy than higher-end instruments. In this study, we investigated linear and random forest models to correct PM2.5 measurements from the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment (DDPHE)’s network of low-cost sensors against measurements from co-located U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Federal Equivalence Method (FEM) monitors. Our training set included data from five DDPHE sensors from August 2018 through May 2019. Our testing set included data from two newly deployed DDPHE sensors from September 2019 through mid-December 2019. In addition to PM2.5, temperature, and relative humidity from the low-cost sensors, we explored using additional temporal and spatial variables to capture unexplained variability in sensor measurements. We evaluated results using spatial and temporal cross-validation techniques. For the long-term dataset, a random forest model with all time-varying covariates and length of arterial roads within 500 m was the most accurate (testing RMSE = 2.9 μg/m3 and R2 = 0.75; leave-one-location-out (LOLO)-validation metrics on the training set: RMSE = 2.2 μg/m3 and R2 = 0.93). For on-the-fly correction, we found that a multiple linear regression model using the past eight weeks of low-cost sensor PM2.5, temperature, and humidity data plus a near-highway indicator predicted each new week of data best (testing RMSE = 3.1 μg/m3 and R2 = 0.78; LOLO-validation metrics on the training set: RMSE = 2.3 μg/m3 and R2 = 0.90). The statistical methods detailed here will be used to correct low-cost sensor measurements to better understand PM2.5 pollution within the city of Denver. This work can also guide similar implementations in other municipalities by highlighting the improved accuracy from inclusion of variables other than temperature and relative humidity to improve accuracy of low-cost sensor PM2.5 data.}

The overall high levels of urban air pollution have been shown to be of a significant risk to city dwellers. However, the impacts of very high but temporally and spatially restricted pollution, and thus exposure, are still poorly understood. Conventional approaches to air quality monitoring are based on networks of static and sparse measurement stations. However, these are prohibitively expensive to capture tempo-spatial heterogeneity and identify pollution hotspots, which is required for the development of robust real-time strategies for exposure control. Current progress in developing low-cost micro-scale sensing technology is radically changing the conventional approach to allow real-time information in a capillary form. But the question remains whether there is value in the less accurate data they generate. This article illustrates the drivers behind current rises in the use of low-cost sensors for air pollution management in cities, while addressing the major challenges for their effective implementation.}

	ABSTRACT = {There is increasing concern about the health impacts of ambient Particulate Matter (PM) exposure. Traditional monitoring networks, because of their sparseness, cannot provide sufficient spatial-temporal measurements characteristic of ambient PM. Recent studies have shown portable low-cost devices (e.g., optical particle counters, OPCs) can help address this issue; however, their application under ambient conditions can be affected by high relative humidity (RH) conditions. Here, we show how, by exploiting the measured particle size distribution information rather than PM as has been suggested elsewhere, a correction can be derived which not only significantly improves sensor performance but which also retains fundamental information on particle composition. A particle size distribution–based correction algorithm, founded on κ -Köhler theory, was developed to account for the influence of RH on sensor measurements. The application of the correction algorithm, which assumed physically reasonable κ values, resulted in a significant improvement, with the overestimation of PM measurements reduced from a factor of ~5 before correction to 1.05 after correction. We conclude that a correction based on particle size distribution, rather than PM mass, is required to properly account for RH effects and enable low cost optical PM sensors to provide reliable ambient PM measurements.},

	ABSTRACT = {The concerns related to particulate matter’s health effects alongside the increasing demands from citizens for more participatory, timely, and diffused air quality monitoring actions have resulted in increasing scientific and industrial interest in low-cost particulate matter sensors (LCPMS). In the present paper, we discuss 50 LCPMS models, a number that is particularly meaningful when compared to the much smaller number of models described in other recent reviews on the same topic. After illustrating the basic definitions related to particulate matter (PM) and its measurements according to international regulations, the device’s operating principle is presented, focusing on a discussion of the several characterization methodologies proposed by various research groups, both in the lab and in the field, along with their possible limitations. We present an extensive review of the LCPMS currently available on the market, their electronic characteristics, and their applications in published literature and from specific tests. Most of the reviewed LCPMS can accurately monitor PM changes in the environment and exhibit good performances with accuracy that, in some conditions, can reach R2 values up to 0.99. However, such results strongly depend on whether the device is calibrated or not (using a reference method) in the operative environment; if not, R2 values lower than 0.5 are observed.},
